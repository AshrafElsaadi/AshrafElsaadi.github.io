As a Senior at the [university of Houston](https://www.uh.edu/nsm/computer-science/) majoring in computer science and minoring in mathmatics I have multiple projects under my belt that each use a unique arsenal of tools to accomplish a unique mission.

[My resume](./AshrafElsaadiResumeUH15.pdf) consist of my current experince and my favorite projects over the years as well a overview of my curriculum and my expected graduation date, moving down the paper I start to talk more about my extra-curricular activites that I am involved in within the realm of student life which have tremdounsly benefitted my professionalism and my business world skills giving me a edge over my peeers.

Feel free to conect with me on my [linked in](www.linkedin.com/in/ashrafelsaadi) I display the groups I work with off campus such as [Perplexity Ai](www.linkedin.com/in/ashrafelsaadi) where I work with them as the connection between the university of Houston student body and the companies mission on campus and foster the companies growth through networking, aswell as just talk about anything that is trending.
